    review:
      "Rupesh is that rare engineer who combines technical skill with absolute dependability. He handled critical tasks that usually require extensive oversight with total autonomy. His reliability gave leadership great comfort, knowing jobs would be done right and fast. Losing him to the MESH team was a bittersweet moment—I genuinely wished I could clone him for both teams.",
    fullReview:
      "You have been wonderful to work with since I joined the team. While you did not get many of the Blue Planet stories, the work you did perform was extremely important. Those tasks were largely tasks that would need extra teaching for most other team members to pick up. Your dependability gave both Krishna and I great comfort to know the job would be done right and quickly. I found myself wanting you in both places (SASI and MESH). I would love for you to be here forever.",

      "Having Rupesh on the team was a game-changer. He was instrumental during our complex Rancher migration and critical ASRI production fixes. He consistently tackled the toughest jobs with confidence, delivering robust solutions at impressive speeds. His technical eagerness and dedication make him the kind of developer no team ever wants to let go of.",

      "It’s truly wonderful to have you in our team. I really appreciate all the support you’ve given, especially in handling the rancher migration, resolving ASRI issues, and providing production support. You’ve taken on tough jobs, picked up challenges with confidence, and delivered solutions quickly. Your hard work and dedication make a big difference, and honestly, I don’t think anyone who has you in their team would ever want to let you go.",
